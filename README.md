# FractalTree-CS
 This GitHub repository contains a C# program that generates and prints out a fractal tree using recursion. The program takes input parameters such as the depth and branch angle of the tree.

The program works by recursively calling a function to draw the branches of the tree. Each branch is split into two smaller branches at a specified angle, and this process is repeated until the desired depth is reached.

The repository includes documentation and sample output images of the fractal tree generated by the program. Additionally, the code is well-commented and structured in a way that is easy to understand and modify, making it a great starting point for anyone interested in learning about recursion and fractal geometry.
